  Threats are modeled as collections. Once you get collections from this tool, you can use `get_collection_report` to fetch the full reports and their relationships.

  **IMPORTANT CONTEXT CLUE:** Pay close attention to the user's request. If their request mentions specific *kinds* of threats such as "threat actor", "malware family", "campaign", "report", or "vulnerability", treat this as a strong signal that you **must** use the `collection_type` filter in your `query` to ensure relevant results. Using this filter significantly improves search precision.

  **Filtering by Type:**
  To filter your search results to a specific *type* of threat, include the `collection_type` modifier *within your query string*.
  Syntax: `collection_type:"<type>"`
  Available `<type>` values:
    - "threat-actor": Use when the user asks about specific actors, groups, or APTs.
    - "malware-family": Use when the user asks about malware, trojans, viruses, ransomware families.
    - "software-toolkit": Use when the user asks about legit tools usually related to malware.
    - "campaign": Use when the user asks about specific attack campaigns.
    - "report": Use when the user is looking for analysis reports.
    - "vulnerability": Use when the user asks about specific CVEs or vulnerabilities.
    - "collection": A generic type, use only if no other type fits or if the user explicitly asks for generic "collections".

  You can use order_by to sort the results by: "relevance", "creation_date". You can use the sign "+" to make it order ascending, or "-" to make it descending. By default is "relevance-"

  When asked for latest threats, prioritize campaigns or vulnerabilities over reports.
