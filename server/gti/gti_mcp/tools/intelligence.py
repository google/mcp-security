  """Search Indicators of Compromise (IOC) in the Google Threat Intelligence platform.

  You can search by for different IOC types using the `entity` modifier. Below, the different IOC types and the supported orders:

    | Entity type   | Supported orders | Default order |
    | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
    | file          | first_submission_date, last_submission_date, positives, times_submitted, size	    | last_submission_date- |
    | url           | first_submission_date, last_submission_date, positives, times_submitted, status   | last_submission_date- |
    | domain        | creation_date, last_modification_date, last_update_date, positives                | last_modification_date- |
    | ip            | ip, last_modification_date, positives                                             | last_modification_date- |

  You can find all available modifers at:
    - Files: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/file-search-modifiers
    - URLs: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/url-search-modifiers
    - Domains: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/domain-search-modifiers
    - IP Addresses: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/ip-address-search-modifiers

  With integer modifers, use the `-` and `+` characters to indicate:
    - Greater than: `p:60+`
    - Less than: `p:60-`
    - Equal to: `p:60`

  Args
    query (required): Search query to find IOCs.
    limit: Limit the number of threats to retrieve. 10 by default.

  Returns:
    List of collections, aka threats.
