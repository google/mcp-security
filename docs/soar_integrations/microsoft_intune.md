# Microsoft Intune Integration

## Overview

This integration allows you to connect to Microsoft Intune to manage devices, including actions like remote lock, sync, locate, wipe, reset passcode, list devices, and test connectivity.

## Configuration

The configuration for this integration (Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret, etc.) is managed within the SOAR platform's Marketplace tab. The actions utilize these pre-configured settings.

## Actions

## Notes

*   Ensure the Microsoft Intune integration is properly configured in the SOAR Marketplace tab.
*   Many actions support targeting devices via Hostname or Host ID, with Host ID taking precedence if both are supplied.
*   Some actions (Remote Lock, Locate Device, Reset Passcode) initiate tasks. Use the "Get Managed Device" action to check the status of these tasks via the `deviceActionResults` field in the response.
