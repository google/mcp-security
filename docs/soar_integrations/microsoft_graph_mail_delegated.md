# Microsoft Graph Mail Delegated Integration

## Overview

This integration allows you to interact with Microsoft 365 mailboxes using delegated permissions via the Microsoft Graph API. It enables actions such as sending emails (including vote emails and HTML emails), managing emails (moving, deleting, marking as junk/not junk), searching emails, downloading attachments, managing tokens, and retrieving mailbox settings.

## Configuration

The configuration for this integration (Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token, etc.) is managed within the SOAR platform's Marketplace tab. The actions utilize these pre-configured settings, specifically requiring delegated permissions.

## Actions

## Notes

*   Ensure the Microsoft Graph Mail Delegated integration is properly configured in the SOAR Marketplace tab with delegated permissions and necessary credentials (including refresh token management).
*   Many actions are asynchronous and may require adjusting script timeouts in the SOAR IDE.
*   Pay attention to required ID formats (mail ID vs. internetMessageId) and time formats.
*   Some actions use beta Microsoft Graph APIs.
