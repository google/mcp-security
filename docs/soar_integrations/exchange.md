# Exchange Integration

## Overview

This integration allows you to connect to Microsoft Exchange and perform various email-related actions, including sending emails (plain text, HTML, vote mails), searching emails, managing attachments, managing inbox rules (add/remove domains/senders, list, delete), blocking/unblocking senders, moving emails, extracting EML data, managing Out Of Facility (OOF) settings, and handling OAuth authentication tokens.

## Configuration

The configuration for this integration (API endpoint, credentials, authentication method like OAuth or Basic) is managed within the SOAR platform's Marketplace tab. The actions utilize these pre-configured settings. Specific permissions like EDiscovery Group, Author permissions, or impersonation might be required for certain actions, as noted in their descriptions.

## Notes

*   Ensure the Exchange integration is properly configured in the SOAR Marketplace tab, including authentication method and necessary permissions (e.g., impersonation, EDiscovery).
*   Some actions require specific Exchange Server versions (e.g., 2013+ for blocking/unblocking senders).
*   Actions involving multiple mailboxes might require impersonation permissions and can be time-consuming; adjust script timeouts accordingly.
*   Pay attention to parameter descriptions for specific formatting requirements (e.g., comma-separated lists, folder paths with '/').
*   OAuth authentication requires a two-step process using `Get Authorization` and `Generate Token` actions.
