# Exchange Extension Pack Integration

## Overview

This integration extends the capabilities of the standard Exchange integration by providing actions to manage Exchange Mail Flow Rules (Transport Rules) and Compliance Searches within Exchange Online or on-premises Exchange Server. It allows adding/removing senders and domains to specific mail flow rules, listing/deleting these rules, running compliance searches, fetching their results, purging results, and deleting the searches.

## Configuration

This integration utilizes the same configuration as the base Exchange integration (API endpoint, credentials, authentication method) managed within the SOAR platform's Marketplace tab. The actions utilize these pre-configured settings. Specific permissions like Organization Management or EDiscovery roles might be required for certain actions, as noted in their descriptions and the official Microsoft documentation.

## Actions

### Add Senders to Exchange-Siemplify Mail Flow Rule

Adds specified senders (email addresses) to an Exchange-Siemplify mail flow rule. If the rule doesn't exist, it will be created. Can optionally add the sender's domain to corresponding domain rules.

**Arguments:**

*   `case_id` (string, required): The ID of the case.
*   `alert_group_identifiers` (List[string], required): Identifiers for the alert groups.
*   `rule_to_add_senders_to` (List[str], required): Specify the rule to add the sender to. If the rule doesn't exist - action will create it where it's missing.
*   `email_addresses` (string, optional): Specify the email addresses you would like to add to the rule, in a comma separated list. If no parameter will be provided, action will work with User entities.
*   `should_add_senders_domain_to_the_corresponding_domains_list_rule_as_well` (bool, optional): Specify whether the action should automatically take the domains of the provided email addresses and add them as well to the corresponding domain rules (same rule action for domains).
*   `target_entities` (List[TargetEntity], optional): Optional list of specific target entities (Identifier, EntityType) to run the action on.
*   `scope` (string, optional): Defines the scope for the action. Defaults to "All entities".

**Returns:**

*   `dict`: A dictionary containing the result of the action execution.

## Notes

*   This integration requires Organization Management permissions in Exchange/O365 for managing mail flow rules and Compliance Search permissions (e.g., eDiscovery Manager) for compliance search actions. Refer to Microsoft documentation for detailed permission requirements.
*   Actions modifying mail flow rules can impact email delivery across the organization. Use with caution.
*   Compliance Search actions can be resource-intensive on the Exchange server, especially when searching across all mailboxes.
*   The `Fetch Compliance Search Results` action has a display limit (e.g., 200 items) in the SOAR UI, but the underlying search may contain more results.
