## Contribution process

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Code quality checks

All pull requests must pass automated code quality checks, including:

- **Trailing spaces check**: Our CI pipeline will automatically check for trailing spaces in **changed lines only** (using `git diff -U0`). If trailing spaces are detected in lines you modified, the check will fail and provide guidance on how to fix them. To remove trailing spaces from your changes before submitting:
  ```bash
  # Remove trailing spaces from a specific file
  sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' filename
  
  # To see which lines have trailing spaces in your changes:
  git diff -U0 | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++' | grep '[[:space:]]$'
  ```
  
  **Note**: Our CI only checks the lines you've modified, not the entire file. This keeps your pull request focused on your changes and avoids introducing unrelated formatting changes.
